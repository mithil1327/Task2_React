                <p>
                    **Venmegha Kirukalgal** is not just a collection of words—it is an artistic
                    expression of emotions, thoughts, and cultural beauty. Just like the drifting
                    white clouds in the sky, poetry flows freely, carrying emotions, memories, and dreams in its rhythm.
                </p>

                    for those who wish to express their untold feelings, and for those who seek to embrace the beauty of the Tamil language.
